# MachineLearning_Assessment

This is the python files and presentation pdf for the Machine learning group exersize.  

The basis for these files is for fine tuning machine learning algorithms and comparison to another machine learning algorithm for performance.

The initial algorithm was different versions of Naive Bayes.  We then compared the categorical and gaussian NB algorithm to a randomforest and logistic regression machine learning algorithms.
The presentation outlines our findings
